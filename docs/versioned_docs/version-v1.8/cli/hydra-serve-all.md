## hydra serve all

Serves both public and administrative HTTP/2 APIs

### Synopsis

Starts a process which listens on two ports for public and administrative HTTP/2
API requests.

If you want more granular control (e.g. different TLS settings) over each API
group (administrative, public) you can run "serve admin" and "serve public"
separately.

This command exposes a variety of controls via environment variables. You can
set environments using "export KEY=VALUE" (Linux/macOS) or "set KEY=VALUE"
(Windows). On Linux, you can also set environments by prepending key value
pairs: "KEY=VALUE KEY2=VALUE2 hydra"

All possible controls are listed below. This command exposes exposes command
line flags, which are listed below the controls section.

## Configuration

ORY Hydra can be configured using environment variables as well as a
configuration file. For more information on configuration options, open the
