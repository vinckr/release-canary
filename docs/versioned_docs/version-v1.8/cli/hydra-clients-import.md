## hydra clients import

Import OAuth 2.0 Clients from one or more JSON files

### Synopsis

This command reads in each listed JSON file and imports their contents as OAuth
2.0 Clients.

The format for the JSON file is:

{ "client_id": "...", "client_secret": "...", // ... all other fields of the
OAuth 2.0 Client model are allowed here }

Please be aware that this command does not update existing clients. If the
client exists already, this command will fail.

Example: hydra clients import client-1.json

To encrypt auto generated client secret, use "--pgp-key", "--pgp-key-url" or
"--keybase" flag, for example: hydra clients import client-1.json --keybase
keybase_username

```
hydra clients import <path/to/file.json> [<path/to/other/file.json>...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                 help for import
      --keybase string       Keybase username for encrypting client secret
      --pgp-key string       Base64 encoded PGP encryption key for encrypting client secret
