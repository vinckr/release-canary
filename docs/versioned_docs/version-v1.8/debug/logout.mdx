id: logout
title: Logout not Working as Expected

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

Sometimes, calling `/oauth2/sessions/logout` does not behave as expected, for
example:

- An error occurs.
- You are being redirected directly to the post_logout_redirect_uri instead of
  the logout UI.

First of all, there are two types of logout requests - one is called "OP (OpenID
Provider) Initiated" and one "RP (Relying Party) Initiated". The first flow MUST
NEITHER contain the `id_token_hint`, nor a `state`, nor
`post_logout_redirect_uri`.

If no active authentication session is set at ORY Hydra, the browser will be
redirected immediately to the system-wide configured post logout redirect URI.

An active session may be missing because:

- You are mixing up domain names (e.g. 127.0.0.1 and localhost - **this is a
  common mistake**)
- You are running ORY Hydra behind a proxy that messes with Cookies
- You are using a Browser with a very strict privacy policy which makes it
  difficult or impossible for ORY Hydra to properly set cookies. We've observed
  that the **Brave Browser** is very, very difficult here.
- You did not set `remember: true` when accepting the login request

**Before filing a bug report, make sure you actually have a cookie named
`oauth2_authentication_session` for the URL ORY Hydra is running on, and
especially for the domain that's in your `http://.../oauth2/sessions/logout`**

If `id_token_hint` is set, you may define both `state` and
`post_logout_redirect_uri`. The same problems can cause this flow to behave
unexpectedly as listed above, with the only difference that now ORY Hydra knows
who the user to be logged out is (from the `id_token_hint`) and if any
Front-/Back-channel Logout is configured for that client, it will be executed
even if there is no valid authentication session for that user in ORY Hydra.
